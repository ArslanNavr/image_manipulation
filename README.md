!! BE ADVISED !!
!! I recommend you open the file with PyCharm. Jupyter Notebook kept giving me errors. !!



''INSTRUCTIONS''

1. Install the following packages:
        from PIL import Image
        import numpy as np
        import os
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from scipy.ndimage import zoom

2. Download the content inside the "data" which is the image called "pickle.png"

3. Inside the "notebooks/pythonProject" folder, open the "main.py" file with PYCHARM.

4. Execute.


PS: Code documentations are included inside the main.py file.
